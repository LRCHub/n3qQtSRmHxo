Lovely is the feeling now
Fever temperatures rising now
Power is the force that vow

That makes it happen
It asks no questions why
Get closer to my body now
Just love me 'till you don't know how
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing like a love desire
I'm melting like candle wax
Sensation lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining
'Cause this is love power
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

Heartbreak is a feeling now
I won't be complaining
'Cause your love is alright
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough keep on
With the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
